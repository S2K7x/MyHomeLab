# 🏠 My Home Lab

Welcome to my Home Lab repository! This is a collection of configurations, scripts, and documentation for my local server environment.

## 🛠 Hardware & Setup

Currently, my lab runs on the following hardware:
- **Beelink**: Running Proxmox for virtualization and heavy lifting.
- **Raspberry Pi 5**: My primary node for core services.
- **Raspberry Pi 500+**: Dedicated to specific tools and custom aliases.
